Mobile App A/B Testing: Optimizing User Retention


📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the impact of "gate" placement on player retention in a mobile game. Using a dataset of 90,189 players, we performed an A/B test to determine if moving the first "gate" (a level where users are forced to wait or pay) from Level 30 to Level 40 improves retention.

Business Goal: Increase the Lifetime Value (LTV) of players by maximizing Day-7 retention.
